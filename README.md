# nano-python-block-counter
Simple python script to count blocks and unchecked blocks from a nano currency node using RPC.

Library used: [nano-python](https://github.com/dourvaris/nano-python)


Outputs nano block count from node in format (Time in UTC):

* JSON: {"time": "2018-08-20 19:29:49", "count": 1931263, "unchecked": 8115, "peers: 10", "interval": 10, "tps": 1.6}
* CSV: Time; Count; Unchecked; Peers; Interval; TPS

Save stats to json and csv files

### Instructions
* Install python version > 3 and pip (sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip)
* pip3 install nano-python
* pip3 install schedule
* Change settings in checkBlocks.py to match your nano node path, intervals and file path. Logfile and console output are optional.
* Run with python3 checkBlocks.py

### Optional: Push stat to [Demo server](https://beta.nanoticker.info)
* Change settings to match server settings. You can get "secret" from me on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/joohansson/) if you have a good node and want to test nano beta.
* Set enableServer = True

**Demo Server also supports [Nano Node Monitor](https://github.com/NanoTools/nanoNodeMonitor)**
